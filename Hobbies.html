          One of my hardest non-programming endeavors was definitely building this computer from scratch!
          I made this computer in the summer of 2018 using store bought parts.
          Some parts include a MSI motherboard, an AMD Ryzen Cpu with 9 core processors, 16gb of ram, a Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 GPU, and much more.
          I now use this computer to work on machine learning and computer Science projects. Additionally, from time to time I would also play video games!

    <h2 class="home">Soccer:</h2>

    <br>

    <p class="home">
      I have been playing soccer for over 12 years now as it is one of my favorite things to play in my spare time.
      Not only does it give a rush of adrenaline to the body, but it is also one of the most physically demanding sports.
      I play soccer on the Leland High School and previously played in a state level environment in a competitve league.
      Soccer allowed me to learn important skills such as time management, team cooperation, and leadership skills which I use in my academic life.
      Without soccer, I would not be the man I am today!

          One of the main reasons I love vacation is for taking pictures!
          My Family and I love to go on vacation to places with extraordinary views and exotic natural parks.
          We have been to places such as the Alaskan Glaciers, Niagra Falls, The Grand Canyon, Yellowstone, and many more.
          I love photography because it allows me to keep a memory fresh in my mind for an eternity and can change your perception of nature.
          The photo on the left is a picture I took of The Grand Canyon in Arizona and it truly amazed me how a bunch of cliffs could be transformed into a masterpiece!

          Photoshop is one of my most favorite ways to express my creativity. One of the many reasons I love distorting and combining images is to create an appealing picture.
          Although this is true, I also use photoshop to send strong morals through a creative outlet. Photoshop allows me to display my emotion with numerous pictures and colors.

    <h2 class="home">Volunteering:</h2>

    <br>

    <p class="home">
      One way I love giving back to the community is by volunteering! I volunteer at a place in downtown San Jose known as the Tech Interactive, Formly known as the Tech Museum.
      The Tech Interactive is an exhibition of new futuristic technological advancements made by engineers. My duty there is to help lead other volunteers and aid
      in managing the technology and machines by displaying and repairing them if necessary. This has sharpened my communicative skills and helped me with understanding the hardware in futuristic machines.
