          One of my projects that I attepmted to create was a visualization for how much the deadly disease of Covid-19 had spread.
          I used an API to get updating data from a public server to see the statistics of how many people were tested positive in different states of India.
          I then used a programming language known as python to transfer the data on to a map.

          Similar to the previous project, I created a visualization of which areas in the United States are more and less affected by Covid-19.
           Using a similar process, I used API's to get America's data and found the longitude and latitude to plot the areas of map which have concentrated amont of people who tested positive fro covid 19.
           This was all done using python.

          You guessed it! I also created one more visualization for the Effects of Covid-19 in Nigeria.
          I implemented the same methods used in the two previous Country with a different API that gave data for confirmed cases of Covid 19 in different states in Nigeria.

              This was my very first app! For this app, I used a programing language known as swift on apple's developer app Xcode.
              This app converted the temperature of something in farenheight to celsius and vice versa.
              Additionally, I used photoshop to design the multiple images displayed in the app!

              Using the programming language Java, I was able to create the card game known as Black Jack.
              To create this, I incorporated many methods and utilized getters and setters to properly pass data throughout the classes.
              This was one of my very first simple game I created!
